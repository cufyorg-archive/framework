  The main project of the cufy organization. The framework is written in java.
  The framework tries to compete with other frameworks. The cufy framework is
  focused on to be more inheritable and more reflection friendly. Making it
  more reliable in big complex projects. The framework still not completely
  ready to be used in really big projects since it is still in the beta stage.
  The framework is divided onto different packages. Each package allowed to use
  specific packages only. And each package have it's own targets.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
