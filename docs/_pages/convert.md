    Java is a type sensitive language. And in complex projects, Sometimes you 
    don't want that complexity. Or sometimes you want to pass a value and you
    want the receiver to convert it to the compatible type. Or you maybe the
    receiver and you want any value to be converted to a specific type. All 
    of that is possible with the convert package.
