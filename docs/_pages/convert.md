description: >-
    Java is a type sensitive language. In complex projects, Sometimes
    you don't want that sensitivity and sometimes you want to pass a
    value, and you want the receiver to convert it to the compatible
    type. Or you maybe the receiver and you want any value to be
    converted to a specific type. All of that is possible with the
    convert package.
