# Convert
Java is a type sensitive language. And in complex projects, Sometimes you 
don't want that complexity. Or sometimes you want to pass a value and you
want the receiver to convert it to the compatible type. Or you maybe the
receiver and you want any value to be converted to a specific type. All 
of that is possible with the convert package.
