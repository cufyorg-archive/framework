# IO
Input and Output ports is kind of the purpose of computers. But it needs
protocols and standards to be able to use it everywhere with the same code.
This package provides utilities to deal with those protocols and standards
more easily.

-   ## Loadables
    The ways to load and save data is different from a position to another,
    but at the end it still data and still be loaded and saved using protocols
    and standards; Loadables in the other hand don't care about how the data will
    be transferred, as long as the data will be transferred successfully.
